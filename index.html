								The last 10 years I have done mostly front end web development
								work though I also have worked closely with quality assurance
								teams during my last position. I enjoy new challenges, playing

								So a friend of my mine found himself in a situation where the
								developer who had been working on a web-site refresh had to
								leave before the project was completed. So I stepped in and
								completed the changes that the office manager and assistant
								office manager wanted. The most interesting part was that I had
								to hunt down the DNS settings as each time I got access to the
								DNS information I would find that service was forwarding the
								requests on to another DNS server. You can check it out <a

								A short biography about some of the things I have seen. <span

						<div class="by-card-body">
							<p>So I am Software Engineer that has been on an interesting
								career path. After graduating from the University of Idaho in
								1999, I started off my career at Sun Microsystems, Inc. My first
								job was working on a replacement for a service request ticketing
								system. The project utilized custom web application framework
								built by Siebel Systems. After a year or so Siebel scrapped the
								their web application to take a new approach which essentially
								tossed out numerous hours of developer work.</p>
							<p>An opportunity came up within Sun IT to work on an
								internal project which gave employees access to their work
								calendars and email at home. How exciting was this! Now remember
								this was in 2000/2001 The internet was just starting to get very
								interesting in that content was no longer so static and use of
								the &lt;blink&rt; tag was declining. Gone were the days of
								looking at web sites with gopher and dynamic sites were starting
								to appear on the scene utilizing Adobe Flash player. The work
								was interesting and eventually the core framework was spun off
								as the Sun Portal Server. After awhile I wanted to try something
								new.</p>
							<p>I next went to Peoplesoft to work with their portal group.
								My stint was short in part because the place seemed chaotic and
								I just didn't really feel like a good fit there. A friend told
								me about a job with Maxtor Corporation which I jumped at. Maxtor
								was a fun job that ended too quickly due to an acquisition by
								Seagate Corp. I was given freedom to drive implementation of the
								Java development environment. I wrote a couple of small JSP
								based apps and eventually ended up taking over development
								responsibilities for www.maxtor.com. The site utilized
								Vignette's content manager and JSP tags for grabbing the
								content. Once news of the acquisition hit I was offered an
								incentive to stay until the company was shut down. Since the
								amount of new content getting published on the web site was
								lessened the system was quite stable. Eventually we got bored
								and would fill the slack time with ping pong, lunch time sand
								volleyball games and the Friday afternoon round of golf with my
								manager.</p>
							<p>When it was time I went back to Sun Microsystems to work
								on Sun One Portal Server. I worked on numerous JSR 168 portlets
								and things were going well until the layoff. This was during
								2007-2008 when the Great Recesion hit. No one was purchasing
								anything and the company killed the product to cut costs since
								it had never been a high revenue generating application. I was
								laid off for about 5 months but got hired again by Sun
								Microsystems to work on the Ops Center product. Initially it
								started off as a competitor to VirtualBox but it evolved in
								software to manage virtualization software for the Sparc OS. I
								worked primarily around the virtual network features doing user
								interface work using Dojo, ExtJS with Java and Spring used in
								the middle layer. The product seemed to be doing ok given the
								business environment but then word came that Oracle Corporation
								was looking to acquire Sun Micro. Those of you who remember
								their history know that eventually Oracle was successful. For
								awhile we continued to work on Ops Center but then we got news
								that we would be re-organized into Oracle's Enterprise Manager
								on the user interface team.</p>
							<p>The change was interesting. Oracle being the large
								software company that they are had a lot of processes in place
								that were not used by the Sun Microsystems group. It took a bit
								of change but it didn't take long to see the value in most of
								these processes and policies. I did this work for 2-3 years and
								then our group was moved of the Enterprise Manager and moved on
								to the Oracle Cloud. I eventually ended up taking ownership for
								the several visualizations. Our product group was responsible
								for Target Analytics and our primary interface was the Universal
								Data Explorer (UDE). The UDE would take various criterion based
								on metrics to filter the data set. Then the visualization could
								render a text display using the criteria metadata or numerous
								graphs including Gauge, Histogram, Bar and Line charts. The work
								was interesting and could be quite challenging at times. I think
								the challenge was what I liked most about the job. Unfortunately
								due to a company acquisition and some internal politics a fairly
								major reduction in force occurred and I have again been thrust
								into the job market to find my new home.</p>
